Welcome to my website!

My name is Jie Hu, and I'm currently pursuing my PH.D. at center for Data Science, Peking University. I obtained my B.S. in Applied Mathematics at Tongji University in 2023.

During my 1st year rotation, I'm very fortunated to be advised by [Prof.Kun yuan](kunyuan827.github.io) in the first semester.
