Welcome to my website!

My name is Jie Hu, and I'm currently pursuing my Ph.D. at Center for Data Science, Peking University. I obtained my B.S. in Applied Mathematics from Tongji University in 2023.

During my first year rotation, I'm incredibly fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Kun Yuan](https://kunyuan827.github.io) in the first semester.

My research interests include development of efficient algorithms and systems for deep learning, software-hardware codesign of AI models, large language model quantization/acceleration.
