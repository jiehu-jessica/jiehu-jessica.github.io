Welcome to my website!

My name is Jie Hu, and I'm currently pursuing my Ph.D. at the Center for Data Science, Peking University. I obtained my BS in Applied Mathematics from Tongji University in 2023.

In my first-year rotation, I'm incredibly fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Kun Yuan](https://kunyuan827.github.io) during the first semester. I'm currently working with [Prof. Chao Yang](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/yangch/english/index.html) to explore some exciting topics.

My research interests include development of efficient algorithms and systems for deep learning, software-hardware co-design of AI models, large language model quantization/acceleration. 

If you are interested, please feel free to contact me through email or ![这是图片](images/Wechat.jpg "Wechat")!
